Described as at least twice the size of robins, but similar colour and proportions. Estimated size; 8-10"" from top of head to ground, 5"" width. Bluey-grey plumage, and wattles distinctly seen. Colour of wattle yellow on one bird and more orange on the other. One seemed to have slightly larger wattles. There seemed to be a slight size difference between the birds too. Bill slightly curved at tip. Relatively long legs. Wing looked relatively short (didn't protrude backwards like e.g. blackbird). Tip of wing rounded, not pointed. Noted that birds hopped rather than ran along ground. Hops of about 2–3"" in length. Hopped on to rotten log about 3 m away, and picked at moss for about 5–10 minutes. Flicked moss off using a sideways motion of bill. The bill was inserted vertically into the moss, then the moss prised loose with a sideways flick. This was very distinct. Each dislodged clump of moss was about 2–3 times the size of a 50 cent coin. The birds were described as curious and confiding.
